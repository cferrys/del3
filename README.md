# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic images.

## Files
- `code.py`: Main script for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- `generate_csv.py`: Generates predictions for test images and outputs `submission.csv`.
- `submission.csv`: File ready for Kaggle submission with predicted labels.

## Usage
1. Run `code.py` to train the model.
2. Run `generate_csv.py` to create `submission.csv` with predictions.

## Dataset
Download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data).
